# Data-Analysis

Using the Internet as a source of data, I wrote programs which scrape, parse, and read web data, as well as access data using web APIs, such as the GeoJSON API. I worked with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python.
Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, HTML, JSON, XML, BeautifulSoup, Socket, Urllib, GeoJSON API
